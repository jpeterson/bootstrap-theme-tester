# bootstrap-theme-tester

## Installing

After pulling:
- `npm install`
- `grunt init`

`grunt init` installs all dependencies before running the `default` task, so you only need to run it once, subsequently you can just run `grunt` to kick off the connect and watch tasks.

## Theme Development
There are only 2 files you need to edit to build a custom theme. This repo gives you 2 sample files (borrowed from [Bootswatch's Flatly theme](https://bootswatch.com/)).

- `styles\_variables.scss`
- `styles\_theme.scss`
